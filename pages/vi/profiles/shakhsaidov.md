## About
Hey all,  
I am a sophomore student studying Computer Science at Lafayette College, hailing from Uzbekistan. Apart from studies and coding, I am into watching/playing football(soccer), watching anime, diving into poetry or reading stuff on the web. I got interested in OLE due to its mission, and hope to be of value contributing in any way I can.
